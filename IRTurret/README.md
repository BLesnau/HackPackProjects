[HackPack Link For IRTurret Project](https://www.crunchlabs.com/products/ir-turret)

## [TurretDance](TurretDance)

Easily make dance routines for the turret to perform. Documentation and examples can be found in the code.

## [TurretRoulette](TurretRoulette)

This is mostly the provided sample project for the roulette game.
- Turret shakes head "yes" if it decides to shoot you
- Turret shakes head "no" if it decides to not shoot you
  - Turret will sometimes lie and actually still shoot
- You can also have the turret animate with recoil after firing.

## [TurretControl](TurretControl)

This is mostly the provided sample project for controlling the turret. You can also have the turret animate with recoil after firing.

## [(TurretCombined](TurretCombined)

All turret projects are combined into a single project and can be switched to with commands like `0->1` or `0->2`. The project is split up into multiple files, so you will not be able to use the HackPack web-based code editor. You will need to you use a different editor like the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code.
