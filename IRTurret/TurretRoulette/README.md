# TurretRoulette

This is mostly the provided sample project for the roulette game.
- Turret shakes head "yes" if it decides to shoot you
- Turret shakes head "no" if it decides to not shoot you
  - Turret will sometimes lie and actually still shoot
- You can also have the turret animate with recoil after firing.
