This is planned functionality that is not yet implemented.

This is all of the IRTurret projects combined into one thing that can be deployed so that you don't need to keep deploying the code to switch between projects.

These button pressed switch between different functionality
- `0->1` [TurretDance](../TurretDance)
- `0->2` [TurretRoulette](../TurretRoulette)
- `0->3` [TurretControl](../TurretControl)
