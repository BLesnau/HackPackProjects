# HackPackProjects

I will be adding my modifications to the HackPack projects here. It will be a mixture of the included projects mixed with my own stuff. The code won't necceesarily be great. My main focus is not craeting the best code for this. For example, I did not creat the code and classes in separate files usually because the HackPack web-based code editor does not support multiple files for a project. I mostly used VS Code, but I wanted to keep supporting the web-based editor to make it easier on others that only use that.

I just want to make fun changes without worrying too much about the code quality. Use at your own risk.

## [IRTurret](IRTurret)

- Sample projects like Roulette and general turret control
- TurretDance to easily make dance routines for the turret to perform
- (Not Implemented) Combine all of the projects into one file so that you can switch between all of them without deploying the code repeatedly.
